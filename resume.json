This enabled us in retiring 3rd party monitoring software thereby saving significant amount of money in license and support cost.\n- Created and implemented blocking and deadlock detecting and created self-service HUMIO realtime charts for application team to be able to troubleshoot issues.\n- Created an automated failover process for AlwaysON Availability group that auto-rebalances the AlwaysON topology to ensure there are atleast 2 sync replicas. This ensures that during machine crash, SQL Server is able to automatically perform failovers without dataloss. Also, this allows machine maintenance on a given node since the process makes it async which minimizes impact on primary sync replica.\n- Automated all the pre and post migration steps using dbatools (https://dbatools.io/) - PowerShell and custom TSQL Scripts.\n- Successfully did a POC of running SQL Server on Kubernetes (K8s).\n- Implemented Query Store for sql server 2016 and up instances thereby providing query perform stats to application team.\n- Mentoring other team members on SQL Server platform along with supporting MySQL open-source RDBMS.",
